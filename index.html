      <p>Reading is defined as a cognitive process that involves decoding symbols to arrive at meaning. Reading is an active process of constructing meanings of words. Reading with a purpose helps the reader to direct information towards a goal and focuses their attention. Although the reasons for reading may vary, the primary purpose of reading is to understand the text. Reading is a thinking process. It allows the reader to use what he or she may already know, also called prior knowledge. During this processing of information, the reader uses strategies to understand what they are reading, uses themes to organize ideas, and uses textual clues to find the meanings of new words. Each of the three components of reading is equally important.Reading enhances our language skills and develops fluency, allowing us to express our thoughts and ideas better. Books quench our thirst for knowledge. ... The right books are full of useful information that helps us become smarter, sharper, more skilled and more open to new ideas.</p>
